# Research_6

### Todo List
- [x] make different directories for all paracetamol and water codes and simulations 
- [ ] add seperate readmefiles to each of the folders
- [ ] collect all the initial files of mdp , pdb , gro and topol files required for both paracetamol and water 
- [ ] now make sure both the pdb files and gro files and the generation of the topol files are correct
- [ ] make relevant changes to the mdp files required for the simulation as per the structure i.e., melt or crystal 
- [ ] initially run 4 simulations for water and paracetamol both each for 100 frames
- [ ] run the same simulation above for 500000 frames for water and 500000 frames for paracetamol
- [ ] And after the simulation is run keep the directory structures clean and evident enough 
- [ ] move the required input and output files to the destination where we can train them for encoders
- [ ] clean write documentation of all the codes 
- [ ] daily commits are mandatory for the response
- [ ] write all the commands links and sources such that they are good enough to be reviewed and one can complete the work from scratch
- [ ] Make the Readme informative and easy enough to understand the work and process carried by you.
